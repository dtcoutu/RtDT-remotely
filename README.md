# Using
Because develop might have happened to change how things are stored it is good to explicitly click "Reset" and to hard refresh the website (Ctrl-R, Cmd-R).

# Developing
Details have been separated into different files, which requires running a local server to avoid CORS request errors from the browser. I'm using the vscode-preview-server to view the pages. Be sure the run the "Resume web server command" as necessary to ensure it can be visited at `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

Note - this is made with love and is not an official Restoration Games product.
